# Assets Directory

This directory contains static assets that are copied to the `dist/` directory during the build process.

## Files

- `favicon.svg` - New document-style favicon with star and chain links, copied to `dist/favicon.svg` during build
- `favicon-new.svg` - Development version with debug lines (for reference)
- `icon.ico` - Legacy ICO format favicon for maximum compatibility

## Usage

Assets are automatically copied during the build process. The favicon represents the URL-to-markdown functionality with:

- Blue background (representing text/markdown)
- White text lines (representing content)
- Green circle (representing links/URLs)
