# URL to Markdown (Logseq Plugin)

This plugin detects pasted URLs in the Logseq editor and replaces them with Markdown links that include the page title (and optionally favicon).

## Usage

Paste a URL in the editor and wait a moment â€” it will auto-convert to:

```md
[Example Domain](https://example.com)
```

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
